Let's start by remembering what a fraction is. A fraction represents a part of a whole, like 1/2 or 3/4.
Now, decimals are another way to show parts of a whole, just written differently. For example, 1/2 is the same as 0.5.

Let's look at how to convert a fraction to a decimal. To do that, you just divide the top number (the numerator) by the bottom number (the denominator). So, if I have 3/4, I divide 3 by 4, which equals 0.75.
Let's try another one: What about 1/5? If I divide 1 by 5, I get 0.2.

Now, let's do it the other wayâ€”turning a decimal into a fraction. For example, if I have 0.4, I think "what place value is the 4 in?" It's in the tenths place, so 0.4 is the same as 4/10. But we always want to simplify our fractions, so 4/10 becomes 2/5.

Fractions and decimals are both useful, and sometimes one is easier to work with than the other, depending on the problem.
Let's practice together! On your worksheet, you'll see a list of fractions and decimals. Try matching each fraction with its equivalent decimal.

When you're done, we'll review the answers as a class and discuss any questions you might have.
Remember: to go from a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. To go from a decimal to a fraction, use the place value and simplify.
